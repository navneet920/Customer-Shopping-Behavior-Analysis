# Customer-Shopping-Behavior-Analysis
Data Analyst Project Showcasing customer behavior analysis using python ,pandas , sql and power Bi.  
# 🧩 Overview

This project demonstrates the complete Data Analytics workflow — from data loading and cleaning to visualization and reporting.
It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), SQL-based insights, and an interactive Power BI dashboard, followed by a summarized report and presentation made using Gamma.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights, build visual representations, and communicate findings effectively to stakeholders.


Content: Contains features such as demographics, transactions, and performance metrics.

# 🚀 Project Steps 

## 1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Verified file encoding and handled missing values during import.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understood dataset structure (shape, types, unique values).

Performed descriptive statistics and distribution plots.

Identified outliers and correlations using heatmaps and boxplots.

## 3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing and duplicate records.

Standardized data types and formats.

Applied transformations for better consistency and usability.

## 4. SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into MySQL.

Executed analytical queries such as:

Top-performing categories or regions

Trend analysis over time

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY)

Filtering and joining across multiple tables

## 5. Power BI Dashboard

Connected cleaned SQL data to Power BI.

Built an interactive dashboard including:

Trend and category analysis visuals

Filters for region, time, and category

## 6. Report & Presentation

Gamma Report: Summarized findings, insights, and recommendations.

PowerPoint (via Gamma): Created a visually appealing presentation highlighting:

Business problem

Key insights

Data-driven recommendations

# 📈 Dashboard Highlights
