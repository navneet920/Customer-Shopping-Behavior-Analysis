# Customer-Shopping-Behavior-Analysis
Data Analyst Project Showcasing customer behavior analysis using python ,pandas , sql and power Bi.  
# 🧩 Overview

This project demonstrates the complete Data Analytics workflow — from data loading and cleaning to visualization and reporting.
It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), SQL-based insights, and an interactive Power BI dashboard, followed by a summarized report and presentation made using Gamma.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights, build visual representations, and communicate findings effectively to stakeholders.

📂 Dataset

Source: Public/open-source dataset (or specify: e.g., Kaggle / Company Data)

Format: CSV / Excel

Size: ~X rows × Y columns

Content: Contains features such as demographics, transactions, and performance metrics.

Objective: Analyze patterns, identify trends, and derive actionable insights.

🚀 Project Steps
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Verified file encoding and handled missing values during import.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understood dataset structure (shape, types, unique values).

Performed descriptive statistics and distribution plots.

Identified outliers and correlations using heatmaps and boxplots.

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing and duplicate records.

Standardized data types and formats.

Applied transformations for better consistency and usability.

4. SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server.

Executed analytical queries such as:

Top-performing categories or regions

Trend analysis over time

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY)

Filtering and joining across multiple tables

5. Power BI Dashboard

Connected cleaned SQL data to Power BI.

Built an interactive dashboard including:

KPIs (e.g., Total Revenue, Avg. Growth Rate)

Trend and category analysis visuals

Filters for region, time, and category

6. Report & Presentation

Gamma Report: Summarized findings, insights, and recommendations.

PowerPoint (via Gamma): Created a visually appealing presentation highlighting:

Business problem

Key insights

Data-driven recommendations

# 📈 Dashboard Highlights

Dynamic filters for drill-down insights.

KPI cards showing major performance indicators.

Time-series visualization for trend analysis.

Category and region comparison charts.
